					<h2>Who am I</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Adam Burnett - http://github.com/aburnett</li>
						<li>B.S. Computer Science - University of Massachusetts Amherst - 2005</li>
						<li>15+ years of professional software development</li>
						<li>Roles include: tech support, developer, recruiter, architect, QA</li>
						<li>Father, mountain biker, skier</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How did I get started</h2>
					<p>
						<b>GAMING!</b> - Quake, LucasArts Games, Mech Warrior, Starcraft, MUDs...
						<img style="display:inline; float:right;" src="img/mud.png" width="300px"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>High School</b> - C++, AP C++, Java.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Personal Interest</b> - Built my own PCs, family tech support, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Work</b> - Worked for a local software company doing random development, QA,
						3D modeling, design and shipping.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is a Career in Software</h2>
					<p>
						Software development is for people who have a passion for <b>solving problems</b>
						with software. You must enjoy <b>constantly learning</b> and improving
						your skills on your own. Most software is developed by a team so
						you must have the ability to <b>work with others</b> and be <b>modest</b>.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The tech industry changes rapidly. A career in software means self
						motivating to constantly stay up to date. Tech you know coming out of
						school will, best case, be uninteresting in 5 years. Worst case, irrelevant.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is a Career in Software</h2>
					<p>
						There are many different roles one can have as part of a career in software.
						<ul style="width: 100%;">
							<li>Developer</li>
							<li>Quality Assurance (Testing)</li>
							<li>Systems Engineering</li>
							<li>Release Engineer</li>
							<li>DBA</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Talk about variations on these roles. Qa - automation vs manual, developer - backend vs front end
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>
						Software is unique in that what you've done speaks louder than where
						you went to school. Many people in software did not start with an engineering
					  degree.
					</p>
					<p>
						That said - unless you have an exceptional portfolio, a BA/BS is required. Computer Science is the
						traditional path for developers. It will give a great understanding of how computers work from top
						to bottom and <i>will</i> make you a better developer. Also, most likely, a higher first salary.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, a Computer Scientist	and a Software Engineer are not exactly the same things.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						CS degree commonly not required for QA, IT, SE type positions. But some other higher education
						is usually looked for.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>
						Some colleges offer a degree in Software Engineering.
					</p>
					<p>
						Self guided and local class options
						<ul>
							<li>Codecademy</li>
							<li>Girl Develop It!</li>
							<li>Countless language specific tutorials</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
					<p>
						Just about <b>anything!</b> Every industry relies on software in some form or another.
						Your code could run on planes, cars, refrigerators, satelites or across thousands of machines
						in a data center.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't get stuck on picking a particular industry to work in. Focus on the technical problems
						that you'll be solving.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						During a job hunt know any industries you won't work in (military, pharma, etc). If you do want to
						target a specific field (gaming, google, etc) be prepared to put in extra work to differentiate yourself
						from the pack.

						For example, I knew I wanted to work on mobile app development but did not limit myself to only writing
						mobile games.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where can you Work?</h2>
					<p>
						Work environment and company culture can vary <b>widely!</b>
						<ul style="width: 100%">
							<li>Solo</li>
							<li>Remote</li>
							<li>Small company (&lt;100 people)</li>
							<li>Large company (1000+ people)</li>
							<li>Consulting - travel intensive or not</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Working remote has it's down sides.
						<ul>
							<li>Requires discipline</li>
							<li>Miss out on lots of communication (i.e. if only part of team is remote)</li>
							<li>Can make it harder to advance within a company</li>
						</ul>
						When working remote you can miss out on a lot of side conversations, whiteboard sessions
						and general face to face interaction with your team.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where can you Work?</h2>
					<p>
						Finding a company that fits you <b>culturally</b> is just as important as finding one
						that will challenge you technically. This isn't just the one with the best free
						snacks!
						<ul>
						  <li>How is this company going to help me progress technically?</li>
							<li>Do they encourage the use of new technology?</li>
							<li>Am I just going to be on-call 24/7?</li>
							<li>Is leadership	transparent about plans and goals?</li>
							<li>Work/life balance?</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A good software company should always be trying to make you a better software
						developer.

						Who wants to end up using the same tech for the next 20 years, or using a tech
						from 20 years ago?

						On-call rotations are not bad, and especially valuable starting out in your career

						Work/life balance is important but software is also fast paced field. Crunch
						time early in your career is expected and a good thing. Working hard because
						that's what needs to be done is one thing, killing yourself because of poor
						planning or leadership is another.
