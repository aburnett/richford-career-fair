					<h2>Who am I</h2>
					<p style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Adam Burnett</u></b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>B.S. Computer Science - University of Massachusetts Amherst - 2005</li>
						<li>15+ years of professional software development</li>
						<li>Roles include: tech support, developer, recruiter, architect, QA</li>
						<li>Father, mountain biker, skier</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How did I get started</h2>
					<p>
						<b>GAMING!</b> - LAN Parties, Quake, LucasArts Games, Mech Warrior, Starcraft, MUDs...
						<img style="display:inline; float:right;" src="img/mud.png" width="300px"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Personal Interest</b> - Built my own PCs, family tech support, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>High School</b> - C++, AP C++, Java.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Work</b> - Worked for a local software company doing random development, QA,
						3D modeling and graphic design.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is a Career in Software</h2>
					<p>
						Software development is for people who have a passion for <b>solving problems</b>.
						You must enjoy <b>constantly learning</b> and improving
						your skills on your own. Most software is developed by a team so
						you must have the ability to <b>work with others</b> and be <b>modest</b>.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Solving problems IS WHAT WE DO!

						The tech industry changes rapidly. A career in software means self
						motivating to constantly stay up to date. Tech you know coming out of
						school will, best case, be uninteresting in 5 years. Worst case, irrelevant.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is a Career in Software</h2>
					<p>
						There are many different roles one can have as part of a career in software.
						<ul style="width: 100%;">
							<li>Developer</li>
							<li>Quality Assurance (Testing)</li>
							<li>Systems Engineering</li>
							<li>Release Engineer</li>
							<li>DBA</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Talk about variations on these roles. Qa - automation vs manual, developer - backend vs front end<br/>
						SE == system admin. Strong networking, OS, automation background.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>
						In Software what you've done speaks louder than where
						you went to school or, even, what you studied.
					</p>
					<p>
						A 2 or 4 year degree or IT training during a military career is generally required by employers.
						Computer Science is the	traditional path for developers. It will give a great understanding
						of how computers work from top to bottom and <i>will</i> make you a better developer.
						Also, most likely, a higher salary.
					</p>
					<p>
						A Computer Scientist and a Software Engineer are not exactly the same things. Some
						universities now offer Software Engineering focused programs or certificates.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Many people in software	did not start with an engineering degree.

						CS degree commonly not required for QA, IT, SE type positions. But some other higher education
						is usually looked for.

						You learn much more than a specific topic in college. Employers want to see that you are
						capable of self guided learning and operating in an environment that isn't public school.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Computer Science</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Programming and Data Structures</li>
							<li>Math - Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra</li>
							<li>Operating Systems</li>
							<li>Networking</li>
							<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
							<li>Algorithms</li>
							<li>Physics</li>
							<li>...additional lab and elective courses</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
					<p>
						Just about <b>anything!</b> Every industry relies on software in some form or another.
						Your code could run on planes, cars, refrigerators, satelites or across thousands of machines
						in a data center.
						<img src="img/datacenter.jpg" style="display:inline; float:right;" width="300px"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't get stuck on picking a particular industry to work in. Focus on the technical problems
						that you'll be solving.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Question - Who knows what "The Cloud" actually is?<br/><br/>
						During a job hunt know any industries you won't work in (military, pharma, etc). If you do want to
						target a specific field (gaming, google, etc) be prepared to put in extra work to differentiate yourself
						from the pack. Learn industry specific tooling, methodologies.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where can you Work?</h2>
					<p>
						Work environment and company culture can vary <b>widely!</b>
						<ul style="width: 100%">
							<li>Solo</li>
							<li>Remote</li>
							<li>Small company (&lt;100 people)</li>
							<li>Large company (1000+ people)</li>
							<li>Consulting - travel intensive or not</li>
						</ul>

						<img src="img/wfh.jpg" width="300px" style="top:225px; right:0%;position:absolute"/>

					</p>
					<p>
						Industries vary <b>widely!</b> When searching for a job note if a company
						is a true software company or a company that has a software division.
						A software company's only product is software vs a company which makes
						something else and has a software group to support the other products.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Working remote has it's down sides.
						<ul>
							<li>Requires discipline</li>
							<li>Miss out on lots of communication (i.e. if only part of team is remote)</li>
							<li>Can make it harder to advance within a company</li>
						</ul>
						When working remote you can miss out on a lot of side conversations, whiteboard sessions
						and general face to face interaction with your team.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where can you Work?</h2>
					<p>
						Finding a company that fits you <b>culturally</b> is just as important as finding one
						that will challenge you technically. This isn't just the one with the best free
						snacks!
						<ul>
						  <li>How is this company going to help me progress technically?</li>
							<li>Do they encourage the use of new technology?</li>
							<li>Am I just going to be on-call 24/7?</li>
							<li>Is leadership	transparent about plans and goals?</li>
							<li>Work/life balance?</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A good software company should always be trying to make you a better software
						developer.

						Who wants to end up using the same tech for the next 20 years, or using a tech
						from 20 years ago?

						On-call rotations are not bad, and especially valuable starting out in your career

						Work/life balance is important but software is also fast paced field. Crunch
						time early in your career is expected and a good thing. Working hard because
						that's what needs to be done is one thing, killing yourself because of poor
						planning or leadership is another.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What would your schedule look like</h2>
					<p>
						Companies organize and prioritize	work in different ways: Scrum, Agile, Kanban, Waterfall.
					</p>
					<p>
						Agile example:
						<ul>
							<li>Teams generally 4-8 people.</li>
							<li>Tasks divided into "stories" which typically take at most 2 weeks to complete.</li>
							<li>Teams decide which stories they can complete in a 2 week cycle.</li>
							<li>Daily stand-up to talk about work in progress.</li>
							<li>At end of 2 weeks teams present work to stake holders. Process starts over.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Talk about contrast with waterfall model.

					<h2>Getting Started Now</h2>
					<p style="text-align: center;">
						<u>Getting started in software development is <b><i>easy!</i></b></u>
					</p>
					<p>
						Learn HTML, CSS, Javascript at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Write cross platform mobile applications with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Learn a programming language! Java, Python, Go, Ruby, Javascript, etc...
					</p>
					<p>
						Write web aplications with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>,
						<a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> or <a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Publish your work on <a href="www.github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> and
						<a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Market Yourself</h2>
					<p>
						You probably suck at writing a resume. <u>And that's OK!</u>
					</p>
					<p>
						A resume filled with classes taken, previous job titles and vague descriptions
						of job functions does not tell employers much about who you are or what problems
						you enjoy solving. It also does not help you stand out among a pack of applicants.
					</p>
					<p>
						Blogging, Tweeting and committing on GitHub are great ways to market yourself. This
						will help build your name in the industry and give you a place to point employers
						to see what kind of developer you are.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Marketing yourself is something I wish I had started much earlier on.

						Stuff to blog about: current project, how you go around/solved a certain
						problem, write tutorials, announce releases of projects you are working on, etc.
